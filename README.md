# Ruhama+ 

The best zero effort fork of a zero effort client you'll ever find!


# This has been made public because:

1. There are very few public clients with a bedaura worth using.
  Most clients simply break the bed, or send too many packets and end up accidentially placing more in the same spot.
  Ruhama+ bedaura automatically finds the best placement, spoofs rotations to best suit the placetarget, and breaks it with your offhand, resulting in no wasted beds.

2. Ruhama+'s improved settings make it much easier to understand and quicker to write than Ruhama or BleachHack.

3. Modules are fairly easy to set up and write.

# Other Info:

The media keys issue **not** not been fixed. I can't find the problem, nor will I try for some time.
