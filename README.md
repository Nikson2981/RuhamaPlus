# Ruhama+ 

The best zero effort fork of a zero effort client you'll ever find! i hate my life


# This has been made public because:

1. the bedaura is shit code that i wrote when i had no java knowledge but it works rofl

1.1 autocrystal is also shit but again it works so

2. Ruhama+'s improved settings make it much easier to understand and quicker to write than Ruhama or BleachHack.

3. Modules are fairly easy to set up and write.

# Other Info:

The media keys issue **not** not been fixed. I can't find the problem, nor will I try for some time.

Fuck Alpine all my homies use MinecraftForge.EVENT_BUS
