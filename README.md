# Ruhama+ 

The best zero effort fork of a zero effort client you'll ever find!


# This has been made public because:

1. There are very few public clients with a bedaura worth using.
  Most clients simply break the bed, or send too many packets and end up accidentially placing more in the same spot.
  Ruhama+ bedaura automatically finds the best placement, spoofs rotations to best suit the placetarget, and breaks it with your offhand, resulting in no wasted beds.
